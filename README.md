## üåü Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide templates for solving recurring issues, improving code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

This repository demonstrates various design patterns in Python with real-world examples and use cases.

---

## ‚ùì Why Design Patterns?

- **Reusability**: Write reusable and modular code.
- **Scalability**: Easily extend and scale your applications.
- **Maintainability**: Simplify debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards and improve collaboration.

## üóÇ Categories of Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reuse.

- **Abstract Factory** - Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step-by-step.
- **Factory Method** - Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Prototype** - Creates new objects by copying an existing object.
- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

### 2. Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition, simplifying relationships between entities.

- **Adapter** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge** - Separates abstraction from implementation for greater flexibility.
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator** - Dynamically adds behaviors to objects without modifying their code.
- **Facade** - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight** - Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
- **Proxy** - Controls access to an object through a surrogate or placeholder.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects, defining how they interact.

- **Chain of Responsibility** - Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Command** - Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Interpreter** - Defines a grammar for interpreting language statements.
- **Iterator** - Provides a way to access elements sequentially without exposing the underlying structure.
- **Mediator** - Centralizes communication between objects.
- **Memento** - Captures and restores an object's internal state.
- **Observer** - Defines a dependency between objects so that one object changes state and others are notified.
- **State** - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy** - Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method** - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses fill in the details.
- **Visitor** - Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure.
